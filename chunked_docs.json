You should be protected from violations of \nprivacy through design choices that ensure such protections are included by default, including ensuring that \ndata collection conforms to reasonable expectations and that only data strictly necessary for the specific \ncontext is collected. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should seek your permission \nand respect your decisions regarding collection, use, access, transfer, and deletion of your data in appropriate \nways and to the greatest extent possible; where not possible, alternative privacy by design safeguards should be \nused. Systems should not employ user experience and design decisions that obfuscate user choice or burden \nusers with defaults that are privacy invasive. Consent should only be used to justify collection of data in cases \nwhere it can be appropriately and meaningfully given. Any consent requests should be brief, be understandable \nin plain language, and give you agency over data collection and the specific context of use; current hard-to\u00ad\nunderstand notice-and-choice practices for broad uses of data should be changed. Enhanced protections and \nrestrictions for data and inferences related to sensitive domains, including health, work, education, criminal \njustice, and finance, and for data pertaining to youth should put you first. In sensitive domains, your data and \nrelated inferences should only be used for necessary functions, and you should be protected by ethical review \nand use prohibitions. You and your communities should be free from unchecked surveillance; surveillance \ntechnologies should be subject to heightened oversight that includes at least pre-deployment assessment of their \npotential harms and scope limits to protect privacy and civil liberties. Continuous surveillance and monitoring \nshould not be used in education, work, housing, or in other contexts where the use of such surveillance \ntechnologies is likely to limit rights, opportunities, or access. Whenever possible, you should have access to \nreporting that confirms your data decisions have been respected and provides an assessment of the \npotential impact of surveillance technologies on your rights, opportunities, or access. \nNOTICE AND EXPLANATION\nYou should know that an automated system is being used and understand how and why it \ncontributes to outcomes that impact you. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems \nshould provide generally accessible plain language documentation including clear descriptions of the overall \nsystem functioning and the role automation plays, notice that such systems are in use, the individual or organiza\u00ad\ntion responsible for the system, and explanations of outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible.

Thus, this framework uses a two-\npart test to determine what systems are in scope. This framework applies to (1) automated systems that (2) \nhave the potential to meaningfully impact the American public\u2019s rights, opportunities, or access to \ncritical resources or services. These rights, opportunities, and access to critical resources of services should \nbe enjoyed equally and be fully protected, regardless of the changing role that automated systems may play in \nour lives. \nThis framework describes protections that should be applied with respect to all automated systems that \nhave the potential to meaningfully impact individuals' or communities' exercise of: \nRIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES, OR ACCESS\nCivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy, including freedom of speech, voting, and protections from discrimi\u00ad\nnation, excessive punishment, unlawful surveillance, and violations of privacy and other freedoms in both \npublic and private sector contexts; \nEqual opportunities, including equitable access to education, housing, credit, employment, and other \nprograms; or, \nAccess to critical resources or services, such as healthcare, financial services, safety, social services, \nnon-deceptive information about goods and services, and government benefits. \nA list of examples of automated systems for which these principles should be considered is provided in the \nAppendix. The Technical Companion, which follows, offers supportive guidance for any person or entity that \ncreates, deploys, or oversees automated systems. \nConsidered together, the five principles and associated practices of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of \nRights form an overlapping set of backstops against potential harms. This purposefully overlapping \nframework, when taken as a whole, forms a blueprint to help protect the public from harm. \nThe measures taken to realize the vision set forward in this framework should be proportionate \nwith the extent and nature of the harm, or risk of harm, to people's rights, opportunities, and \naccess. \nRELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING LAW AND POLICY\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is an exercise in envisioning a future where the American public is \nprotected from the potential harms, and can fully enjoy the benefits, of automated systems. It describes princi\u00ad\nples that can help ensure these protections. Some of these protections are already required by the U.S. Constitu\u00ad\ntion or implemented under existing U.S. laws. For example, government surveillance, and data search and \nseizure are subject to legal requirements and judicial oversight. There are Constitutional requirements for \nhuman review of criminal investigative matters and statutory requirements for judicial review. Civil rights laws \nprotect the American people against discrimination. \n8\n",

        "page_content": "SECTION TITLE\n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplying The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \nRELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING LAW AND POLICY\nThere are regulatory safety requirements for medical devices, as well as sector-, population-, or technology-spe\u00ad\ncific privacy and security protections. Ensuring some of the additional protections proposed in this framework \nwould require new laws to be enacted or new policies and practices to be adopted. In some cases, exceptions to \nthe principles described in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights may be necessary to comply with existing law, \nconform to the practicalities of a specific use case, or balance competing public interests. In particular, law \nenforcement, and other regulatory contexts may require government actors to protect civil rights, civil liberties, \nand privacy in a manner consistent with, but using alternate mechanisms to, the specific principles discussed in \nthis framework. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is meant to assist governments and the private sector in \nmoving principles into practice. \nThe expectations given in the Technical Companion are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of \nadditional technical standards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts. While \nexisting laws informed the development of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, this framework does not detail \nthose laws beyond providing them as examples, where appropriate, of existing protective measures. This \nframework instead shares a broad, forward-leaning vision of recommended principles for automated system \ndevelopment and use to inform private and public involvement with these systems where they have the poten\u00ad\ntial to meaningfully impact rights, opportunities, or access. Additionally, this framework does not analyze or \ntake a position on legislative and regulatory proposals in municipal, state, and federal government, or those in \nother countries. \nWe have seen modest progress in recent years, with some state and local governments responding to these prob\u00ad\nlems with legislation, and some courts extending longstanding statutory protections to new and emerging tech\u00ad\nnologies. There are companies working to incorporate additional protections in their design and use of auto\u00ad\nmated systems, and researchers developing innovative guardrails. Advocates, researchers, and government \norganizations have proposed principles for the ethical use of AI and other automated systems. These include \nthe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD\u2019s) 2019 Recommendation on Artificial \nIntelligence, which includes principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI and which the United \nStates adopted, and Executive Order 13960 on Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the \nFederal Government, which sets out principles that govern the federal government\u2019s use of AI. The Blueprint \nfor an AI Bill of Rights is fully consistent with these principles and with the direction in Executive Order 13985 \non Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. \nThese principles find kinship in the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), derived from the 1973 report \nof an advisory committee to the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Records, Computers, \nand the Rights of Citizens.4 While there is no single, universal articulation of the FIPPs, these core \nprinciples for managing information about individuals have been incorporated into data privacy laws and \npolicies across the globe.5 The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights embraces elements of the FIPPs that are \nparticularly relevant to automated systems, without articulating a specific set of FIPPs or scoping \napplicability or the interests served to a single particular domain, like privacy, civil rights and civil liberties, \nethics, or risk management. The Technical Companion builds on this prior work to provide practical next \nsteps to move these principles into practice and promote common approaches that allow technological \ninnovation to flourish while protecting people from harm. \n9\n",

        "page_content": "Applying The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \nDEFINITIONS\nALGORITHMIC DISCRIMINATION: \u201cAlgorithmic discrimination\u201d occurs when automated systems \ncontribute to unjustified different treatment or impacts disfavoring people based on their race, color, ethnicity, \nsex (including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifica-\ntion protected by law. Depending on the specific circumstances, such algorithmic discrimination may violate \nlegal protections. Throughout this framework the term \u201calgorithmic discrimination\u201d takes this meaning (and \nnot a technical understanding of discrimination as distinguishing between items). \nAUTOMATED SYSTEM: An \"automated system\" is any system, software, or process that uses computation as \nwhole or part of a system to determine outcomes, make or aid decisions, inform policy implementation, collect \ndata or observations, or otherwise interact with individuals and/or communities. Automated systems \ninclude, but are not limited to, systems derived from machine learning, statistics, or other data processing \nor artificial intelligence techniques, and exclude passive computing infrastructure. \u201cPassive computing \ninfrastructure\u201d is any intermediary technology that does not influence or determine the outcome of decision, \nmake or aid in decisions, inform policy implementation, or collect data or observations, including web \nhosting, domain registration, networking, caching, data storage, or cybersecurity. Throughout this \nframework, automated systems that are considered in scope are only those that have the potential to \nmeaningfully impact individuals\u2019 or communi-ties\u2019 rights, opportunities, or access. \nCOMMUNITIES: \u201cCommunities\u201d include: neighborhoods; social network connections (both online and \noffline); families (construed broadly); people connected by affinity, identity, or shared traits; and formal organi-\nzational ties. This includes Tribes, Clans, Bands, Rancherias, Villages, and other Indigenous communities. AI \nand other data-driven automated systems most directly collect data on, make inferences about, and may cause \nharm to individuals. But the overall magnitude of their impacts may be most readily visible at the level of com-\nmunities. Accordingly, the concept of community is integral to the scope of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. \nUnited States law and policy have long employed approaches for protecting the rights of individuals, but exist-\ning frameworks have sometimes struggled to provide protections when effects manifest most clearly at a com-\nmunity level. For these reasons, the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights asserts that the harms of automated \nsystems should be evaluated, protected against, and redressed at both the individual and community levels. \nEQUITY: \u201cEquity\u201d means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals. \nSystemic, fair, and just treatment must take into account the status of individuals who belong to underserved \ncommunities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American \npersons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; \nwomen, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) \npersons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely \naffected by persistent poverty or inequality. \nRIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES, OR ACCESS: \u201cRights, opportunities, or access\u201d is used to indicate the scoping \nof this framework. It describes the set of: civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy, including freedom of speech, \nvoting, and protections from discrimination, excessive punishment, unlawful surveillance, and violations of \nprivacy and other freedoms in both public and private sector contexts; equal opportunities, including equitable \naccess to education, housing, credit, employment, and other programs; or, access to critical resources or \nservices, such as healthcare, financial services, safety, social services, non-deceptive information about goods \nand services, and government benefits. \n10\n",

This technical companion considers each principle in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and \nprovides examples and concrete steps for communities, industry, governments, and others to take in order to \nbuild these protections into policy, practice, or the technological design process. \nTaken together, the technical protections and practices laid out in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights can help \nguard the American public against many of the potential and actual harms identified by researchers, technolo\u00ad\ngists, advocates, journalists, policymakers, and communities in the United States and around the world. This \ntechnical companion is intended to be used as a reference by people across many circumstances \u2013 anyone \nimpacted by automated systems, and anyone developing, designing, deploying, evaluating, or making policy to \ngovern the use of an automated system. \nEach principle is accompanied by three supplemental sections: \n1\n2\nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT: \nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems that the principle seeks to address and protect against, including \nillustrative examples. \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS: \n\u2022 The expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional technical\nstandards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts.\n\u2022 This section outlines practical steps that can be implemented to realize the vision of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. The \nexpectations laid out often mirror existing practices for technology development, including pre-deployment testing, ongoing \nmonitoring, and governance structures for automated systems, but also go further to address unmet needs for change and offer \nconcrete directions for how those changes can be made. \n\u2022 Expectations about reporting are intended for the entity developing or using the automated system. The resulting reports can \nbe provided to the public, regulators, auditors, industry standards groups, or others engaged in independent review, and should \nbe made public as much as possible consistent with law, regulation, and policy, and noting that intellectual property, law \nenforcement, or national security considerations may prevent public release. Where public reports are not possible, the \ninformation should be provided to oversight bodies and privacy, civil liberties, or other ethics officers charged with safeguard \ning individuals\u2019 rights. These reporting expectations are important for transparency, so the American people can have\nconfidence that their rights, opportunities, and access as well as their expectations about technologies are respected. \n3\nHOW THESE PRINCIPLES CAN MOVE INTO PRACTICE: \nThis section provides real-life examples of how these guiding principles can become reality, through laws, policies, and practices. \nIt describes practical technical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights, opportunities, and access. \nThe examples provided are not critiques or endorsements, but rather are offered as illustrative cases to help \nprovide a concrete vision for actualizing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Effectively implementing these \nprocesses require the cooperation of and collaboration among industry, civil society, researchers, policymakers, \ntechnologists, and the public. \n14\n",

In other cases, technologies do not work as intended or as promised, causing substantial and unjustified harm. \nAutomated systems sometimes rely on data from other systems, including historical data, allowing irrelevant informa\u00ad\ntion from past decisions to infect decision-making in unrelated situations.  In some cases, technologies are purposeful\u00ad\nly designed to violate the safety of others, such as technologies designed to facilitate stalking; in other cases, intended \nor unintended uses lead to unintended harms. \nMany of the harms resulting from these technologies are preventable, and actions are already being taken to protect \nthe public. Some companies have put in place safeguards that have prevented harm from occurring by ensuring that \nkey development decisions are vetted by an ethics review; others have identified and mitigated harms found through \npre-deployment testing and ongoing monitoring processes. Governments at all levels have existing public consulta\u00ad\ntion processes that may be applied when considering the use of new automated systems, and existing product develop\u00ad\nment and testing practices already protect the American public from many potential harms. \nStill, these kinds of practices are deployed too rarely and unevenly. Expanded, proactive protections could build on \nthese existing practices, increase confidence in the use of automated systems, and protect the American public. Inno\u00ad\nvators deserve clear rules of the road that allow new ideas to flourish, and the American public deserves protections \nfrom unsafe outcomes. All can benefit from assurances that automated systems will be designed, tested, and consis\u00ad\ntently confirmed to work as intended, and that they will be proactively protected from foreseeable unintended harm\u00ad\nful outcomes. \n\u2022\nA proprietary model was developed to predict the likelihood of sepsis in hospitalized patients and was imple\u00ad\nmented at hundreds of hospitals around the country. An independent study showed that the model predictions\nunderperformed relative to the designer\u2019s claims while also causing \u2018alert fatigue\u2019 by falsely alerting\nlikelihood of sepsis.6\n\u2022\nOn social media, Black people who quote and criticize racist messages have had their own speech silenced when\na platform\u2019s automated moderation system failed to distinguish this \u201ccounter speech\u201d (or other critique\nand journalism) from the original hateful messages to which such speech responded.7\n\u2022\nA device originally developed to help people track and find lost items has been used as a tool by stalkers to track\nvictims\u2019 locations in violation of their privacy and safety. The device manufacturer took steps after release to\nprotect people from unwanted tracking by alerting people on their phones when a device is found to be moving\nwith them over time and also by having the device make an occasional noise, but not all phones are able\nto receive the notification and the devices remain a safety concern due to their misuse.8 \n\u2022\nAn algorithm used to deploy police was found to repeatedly send police to neighborhoods they regularly visit,\neven if those neighborhoods were not the ones with the highest crime rates. These incorrect crime predictions\nwere the result of a feedback loop generated from the reuse of data from previous arrests and algorithm\npredictions.9\n16\n",

These expectations are explained below. \nProtect the public from harm in a proactive and ongoing manner \nConsultation. The public should be consulted in the design, implementation, deployment, acquisition, and \nmaintenance phases of automated system development, with emphasis on early-stage consultation before a \nsystem is introduced or a large change implemented. This consultation should directly engage diverse impact\u00ad\ned communities to consider concerns and risks that may be unique to those communities, or disproportionate\u00ad\nly prevalent or severe for them. The extent of this engagement and the form of outreach to relevant stakehold\u00ad\ners may differ depending on the specific automated system and development phase, but should include \nsubject matter, sector-specific, and context-specific experts as well as experts on potential impacts such as \ncivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy experts. For private sector applications, consultations before product \nlaunch may need to be confidential. Government applications, particularly law enforcement applications or \napplications that raise national security considerations, may require confidential or limited engagement based \non system sensitivities and preexisting oversight laws and structures. Concerns raised in this consultation \nshould be documented, and the automated system developers were proposing to create, use, or deploy should \nbe reconsidered based on this feedback. \nTesting. Systems should undergo extensive testing before deployment. This testing should follow \ndomain-specific best practices, when available, for ensuring the technology will work in its real-world \ncontext. Such testing should take into account both the specific technology used and the roles of any human \noperators or reviewers who impact system outcomes or effectiveness; testing should include both automated \nsystems testing and human-led (manual) testing. Testing conditions should mirror as closely as possible the \nconditions in which the system will be deployed, and new testing may be required for each deployment to \naccount for material differences in conditions from one deployment to another. Following testing, system \nperformance should be compared with the in-place, potentially human-driven, status quo procedures, with \nexisting human performance considered as a performance baseline for the algorithm to meet pre-deployment, \nand as a lifecycle minimum performance standard. Decision possibilities resulting from performance testing \nshould include the possibility of not deploying the system. \nRisk identification and mitigation. Before deployment, and in a proactive and ongoing manner, poten\u00ad\ntial risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated. Identified risks should focus on the \npotential for meaningful impact on people\u2019s rights, opportunities, or access and include those to impacted \ncommunities that may not be direct users of the automated system, risks resulting from purposeful misuse of \nthe system, and other concerns identified via the consultation process. Assessment and, where possible, mea\u00ad\nsurement of the impact of risks should be included and balanced such that high impact risks receive attention \nand mitigation proportionate with those impacts. Automated systems with the intended purpose of violating \nthe safety of others should not be developed or used; systems with such safety violations as identified unin\u00ad\ntended consequences should not be used until the risk can be mitigated. Ongoing risk mitigation may necessi\u00ad\ntate rollback or significant modification to a launched automated system. \n18\n",

Automated systems should have ongoing monitoring procedures, including recalibra\u00ad\ntion procedures, in place to ensure that their performance does not fall below an acceptable level over time, \nbased on changing real-world conditions or deployment contexts, post-deployment modification, or unexpect\u00ad\ned conditions. This ongoing monitoring should include continuous evaluation of performance metrics and \nharm assessments, updates of any systems, and retraining of any machine learning models as necessary, as well \nas ensuring that fallback mechanisms are in place to allow reversion to a previously working system. Monitor\u00ad\ning should take into account the performance of both technical system components (the algorithm as well as \nany hardware components, data inputs, etc.) and human operators. It should include mechanisms for testing \nthe actual accuracy of any predictions or recommendations generated by a system, not just a human operator\u2019s \ndetermination of their accuracy. Ongoing monitoring procedures should include manual, human-led monitor\u00ad\ning as a check in the event there are shortcomings in automated monitoring systems. These monitoring proce\u00ad\ndures should be in place for the lifespan of the deployed automated system. \nClear organizational oversight. Entities responsible for the development or use of automated systems \nshould lay out clear governance structures and procedures.  This includes clearly-stated governance proce\u00ad\ndures before deploying the system, as well as responsibility of specific individuals or entities to oversee ongoing \nassessment and mitigation.

Data that is derived from other data through \nthe use of algorithms, such as data derived or inferred from prior model outputs, should be identified and \ntracked, e.g., via a specialized type in a data schema. Derived data should be viewed as potentially high-risk \ninputs that may lead to feedback loops, compounded harm, or inaccurate results. Such sources should be care\u00ad\nfully validated against the risk of collateral consequences. \nData reuse limits in sensitive domains. Data reuse, and especially data reuse in a new context, can result \nin the spreading and scaling of harms. Data from some domains, including criminal justice data and data indi\u00ad\ncating adverse outcomes in domains such as finance, employment, and housing, is especially sensitive, and in \nsome cases its reuse is limited by law. Accordingly, such data should be subject to extra oversight to ensure \nsafety and efficacy. Data reuse of sensitive domain data in other contexts (e.g., criminal data reuse for civil legal \nmatters or private sector use) should only occur where use of such data is legally authorized and, after examina\u00ad\ntion, has benefits for those impacted by the system that outweigh identified risks and, as appropriate, reason\u00ad\nable measures have been implemented to mitigate the identified risks. Such data should be clearly labeled to \nidentify contexts for limited reuse based on sensitivity. Where possible, aggregated datasets may be useful for \nreplacing individual-level sensitive data. \nDemonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the system \nIndependent evaluation. Automated systems should be designed to allow for independent evaluation (e.g., \nvia application programming interfaces). Independent evaluators, such as researchers, journalists, ethics \nreview boards, inspectors general, and third-party auditors, should be given access to the system and samples \nof associated data, in a manner consistent with privacy, security, law, or regulation (including, e.g., intellectual \nproperty law), in order to perform such evaluations. Mechanisms should be included to ensure that system \naccess for evaluation is: provided in a timely manner to the deployment-ready version of the system; trusted to \nprovide genuine, unfiltered access to the full system; and truly independent such that evaluator access cannot \nbe revoked without reasonable and verified justification. \nReporting.12 Entities responsible for the development or use of automated systems should provide \nregularly-updated reports that include: an overview of the system, including how it is embedded in the \norganization\u2019s business processes or other activities, system goals, any human-run procedures that form a \npart of the system, and specific performance expectations; a description of any data used to train machine \nlearning models or for other purposes, including how data sources were processed and interpreted, a \nsummary of what data might be missing, incomplete, or erroneous, and data relevancy justifications; the \nresults of public consultation such as concerns raised and any decisions made due to these concerns; risk \nidentification and management assessments and any steps taken to mitigate potential harms; the results of \nperformance testing including, but not limited to, accuracy, differential demographic impact, resulting \nerror rates (overall and per demographic group), and comparisons to previously deployed systems; \nongoing monitoring procedures and regular performance testing reports, including monitoring frequency, \nresults, and actions taken; and the procedures for and results from independent evaluations.

These principles\u2014while taking into account the sensitive law enforcement and other contexts in which \nthe federal government may use AI, as opposed to private sector use of AI\u2014require that AI is: (a) lawful and \nrespectful of our Nation\u2019s values; (b) purposeful and performance-driven; (c) accurate, reliable, and effective; (d) \nsafe, secure, and resilient; (e) understandable; (f ) responsible and traceable; (g) regularly monitored; (h) transpar-\nent; and, (i) accountable. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is consistent with the Executive Order. \nAffected agencies across the federal government have released AI use case inventories13 and are implementing \nplans to bring those AI systems into compliance with the Executive Order or retire them. \nThe law and policy landscape for motor vehicles shows that strong safety regulations\u2014and \nmeasures to address harms when they occur\u2014can enhance innovation in the context of com-\nplex technologies. Cars, like automated digital systems, comprise a complex collection of components. \nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,14 through its rigorous standards and independent \nevaluation, helps make sure vehicles on our roads are safe without limiting manufacturers\u2019 ability to \ninnovate.15 At the same time, rules of the road are implemented locally to impose contextually appropriate \nrequirements on drivers, such as slowing down near schools or playgrounds.16\nFrom large companies to start-ups, industry is providing innovative solutions that allow \norganizations to mitigate risks to the safety and efficacy of AI systems, both before \ndeployment and through monitoring over time.17 These innovative solutions include risk \nassessments, auditing mechanisms, assessment of organizational procedures, dashboards to allow for ongoing \nmonitoring, documentation procedures specific to model assessments, and many other strategies that aim to \nmitigate risks posed by the use of AI to companies\u2019 reputation, legal responsibilities, and other product safety \nand effectiveness concerns. \nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has called for an expansion of opportunities \nfor meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design of programs and services. OMB also \npoints to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement, including the Community-\nBased Participatory Research Program developed by the National Institutes of Health and the participatory \ntechnology assessments developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.18\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a risk \nmanagement framework to better manage risks posed to individuals, organizations, and \nsociety by AI.19 The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, as mandated by Congress, is intended for \nvoluntary use to help incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and \nevaluation of AI products, services, and systems. The NIST framework is being developed through a consensus-\ndriven, open, transparent, and collaborative process that includes workshops and other opportunities to provide \ninput. The NIST framework aims to foster the development of innovative approaches to address \ncharacteristics of trustworthiness including accuracy, explainability and interpretability, reliability, privacy, \nrobustness, safety, security (resilience), and mitigation of unintended and/or harmful bias, as well as of \nharmful \nuses. \nThe \nNIST \nframework \nwill \nconsider \nand \nencompass \nprinciples \nsuch \nas \ntransparency, accountability, and fairness during pre-design, design and development, deployment, use, \nand testing and evaluation of AI technologies and systems.

Multiple NSF programs support research that directly addresses many of these principles: \nthe National AI Research Institutes23 support research on all aspects of safe, trustworthy, fair, and explainable \nAI algorithms and systems; the Cyber Physical Systems24 program supports research on developing safe \nautonomous and cyber physical systems with AI components; the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace25 \nprogram supports research on cybersecurity and privacy enhancing technologies in automated systems; the \nFormal Methods in the Field26 program supports research on rigorous formal verification and analysis of \nautomated systems and machine learning, and the Designing Accountable Software Systems27 program supports \nresearch on rigorous and reproducible methodologies for developing software systems with legal and regulatory \ncompliance in mind. \nSome state legislatures have placed strong transparency and validity requirements on \nthe use of pretrial risk assessments.

For example, facial recognition technology that can contribute to wrongful and discriminatory \narrests,31 hiring algorithms that inform discriminatory decisions, and healthcare algorithms that discount \nthe severity of certain diseases in Black Americans. Instances of discriminatory practices built into and \nresulting from AI and other automated systems exist across many industries, areas, and contexts. While automated \nsystems have the capacity to drive extraordinary advances and innovations, algorithmic discrimination \nprotections should be built into their design, deployment, and ongoing use. \nMany companies, non-profits, and federal government agencies are already taking steps to ensure the public \nis protected from algorithmic discrimination. Some companies have instituted bias testing as part of their product \nquality assessment and launch procedures, and in some cases this testing has led products to be changed or not \nlaunched, preventing harm to the public. Federal government agencies have been developing standards and guidance \nfor the use of automated systems in order to help prevent bias. Non-profits and companies have developed best \npractices for audits and impact assessments to help identify potential algorithmic discrimination and provide \ntransparency to the public in the mitigation of such biases. \nBut there is much more work to do to protect the public from algorithmic discrimination to use and design \nautomated systems in an equitable way. The guardrails protecting the public from discrimination in their daily \nlives should include their digital lives and impacts\u2014basic safeguards against abuse, bias, and discrimination to \nensure that all people are treated fairly when automated systems are used. This includes all dimensions of their \nlives, from hiring to loan approvals, from medical treatment and payment to encounters with the criminal \njustice system. Ensuring equity should also go beyond existing guardrails to consider the holistic impact that \nautomated systems make on underserved communities and to institute proactive protections that support these \ncommunities. \n\u2022\nAn automated system using nontraditional factors such as educational attainment and employment history as\npart of its loan underwriting and pricing model was found to be much more likely to charge an applicant who\nattended a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) higher loan prices for refinancing a student loan\nthan an applicant who did not attend an HBCU. This was found to be true even when controlling for\nother credit-related factors.32\n\u2022\nA hiring tool that learned the features of a company's employees (predominantly men) rejected women appli\u00ad\ncants for spurious and discriminatory reasons; resumes with the word \u201cwomen\u2019s,\u201d such as \u201cwomen\u2019s\nchess club captain,\u201d were penalized in the candidate ranking.33\n\u2022\nA predictive model marketed as being able to predict whether students are likely to drop out of school was\nused by more than 500 universities across the country. The model was found to use race directly as a predictor,\nand also shown to have large disparities by race; Black students were as many as four times as likely as their\notherwise similar white peers to be deemed at high risk of dropping out. These risk scores are used by advisors \nto guide students towards or away from majors, and some worry that they are being used to guide\nBlack students away from math and science subjects.34\n\u2022\nA risk assessment tool designed to predict the risk of recidivism for individuals in federal custody showed\nevidence of disparity in prediction. The tool overpredicts the risk of recidivism for some groups of color on the\ngeneral recidivism tools, and underpredicts the risk of recidivism for some groups of color on some of the\nviolent recidivism tools. The Department of Justice is working to reduce these disparities and has\npublicly released a report detailing its review of the tool.35 \n24\n",

For example, the analyzer marked the statement \u201cI\u2019m a Jew\u201d as representing a negative sentiment,\nwhile \u201cI\u2019m a Christian\u201d was identified as expressing a positive sentiment.36 This could lead to the\npreemptive blocking of social media comments such as: \u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d A related company with this bias concern\nhas made their data public to encourage researchers to help address the issue37 and has released reports\nidentifying and measuring this problem as well as detailing attempts to address it.38\n\u2022\nSearches for \u201cBlack girls,\u201d \u201cAsian girls,\u201d or \u201cLatina girls\u201d return predominantly39 sexualized content, rather\nthan role models, toys, or activities.40 Some search engines have been working to reduce the prevalence of\nthese results, but the problem remains.41\n\u2022\nAdvertisement delivery systems that predict who is most likely to click on a job advertisement end up deliv-\nering ads in ways that reinforce racial and gender stereotypes, such as overwhelmingly directing supermar-\nket cashier ads to women and jobs with taxi companies to primarily Black people.42\u00ad\n\u2022\nBody scanners, used by TSA at airport checkpoints, require the operator to select a \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d\nscanning setting based on the passenger\u2019s sex, but the setting is chosen based on the operator\u2019s perception of\nthe passenger\u2019s gender identity. These scanners are more likely to flag transgender travelers as requiring\nextra screening done by a person. Transgender travelers have described degrading experiences associated\nwith these extra screenings.43 TSA has recently announced plans to implement a gender-neutral algorithm44 \nwhile simultaneously enhancing the security effectiveness capabilities of the existing technology. \n\u2022\nThe National Disabled Law Students Association expressed concerns that individuals with disabilities were\nmore likely to be flagged as potentially suspicious by remote proctoring AI systems because of their disabili-\nty-specific access needs such as needing longer breaks or using screen readers or dictation software.45 \n\u2022\nAn algorithm designed to identify patients with high needs for healthcare systematically assigned lower\nscores (indicating that they were not as high need) to Black patients than to those of white patients, even\nwhen those patients had similar numbers of chronic conditions and other markers of health.46 In addition,\nhealthcare clinical algorithms that are used by physicians to guide clinical decisions may include\nsociodemographic variables that adjust or \u201ccorrect\u201d the algorithm\u2019s output on the basis of a patient\u2019s race or\nethnicity, which can lead to race-based health inequities.47\n25\nAlgorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections \n",

Protection against algorithmic discrimination should include designing to ensure equity, broadly \nconstrued.  Some algorithmic discrimination is already prohibited under existing anti-discrimination law. The \nexpectations set out below describe proactive technical and policy steps that can be taken to not only \nreinforce those legal protections but extend beyond them to ensure equity for underserved communities48 \neven in circumstances where a specific legal protection may not be clearly established. These protections \nshould be instituted throughout the design, development, and deployment process and are described below \nroughly in the order in which they would be instituted. \nProtect the public from algorithmic discrimination in a proactive and ongoing manner \nProactive assessment of equity in design. Those responsible for the development, use, or oversight of \nautomated systems should conduct proactive equity assessments in the design phase of the technology \nresearch and development or during its acquisition to review potential input data, associated historical \ncontext, accessibility for people with disabilities, and societal goals to identify potential discrimination and \neffects on equity resulting from the introduction of the technology. The assessed groups should be as inclusive \nas possible of the underserved communities mentioned in the equity definition:  Black, Latino, and Indigenous \nand Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of \nreligious minorities; women, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and inter-\nsex (LGBTQI+) persons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons \notherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Assessment could include both qualitative \nand quantitative evaluations of the system. This equity assessment should also be considered a core part of the \ngoals of the consultation conducted as part of the safety and efficacy review. \nRepresentative and robust data. Any data used as part of system development or assessment should be \nrepresentative of local communities based on the planned deployment setting and should be reviewed for bias \nbased on the historical and societal context of the data. Such data should be sufficiently robust to identify and \nhelp to mitigate biases and potential harms. \nGuarding against proxies.  Directly using demographic information in the design, development, or \ndeployment of an automated system (for purposes other than evaluating a system for discrimination or using \na system to counter discrimination) runs a high risk of leading to algorithmic discrimination and should be \navoided. In many cases, attributes that are highly correlated with demographic features, known as proxies, can \ncontribute to algorithmic discrimination. In cases where use of the demographic features themselves would \nlead to illegal algorithmic discrimination, reliance on such proxies in decision-making (such as that facilitated \nby an algorithm) may also be prohibited by law. Proactive testing should be performed to identify proxies by \ntesting for correlation between demographic information and attributes in any data used as part of system \ndesign, development, or use. If a proxy is identified, designers, developers, and deployers should remove the \nproxy; if needed, it may be possible to identify alternative attributes that can be used instead. At a minimum, \norganizations should ensure a proxy feature is not given undue weight and should monitor the system closely \nfor any resulting algorithmic discrimination.   \n26\nAlgorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections \n",

Systems should be \ndesigned, developed, and deployed by organizations in ways that ensure accessibility to people with disabili\u00ad\nties. This should include consideration of a wide variety of disabilities, adherence to relevant accessibility \nstandards, and user experience research both before and after deployment to identify and address any accessi\u00ad\nbility barriers to the use or effectiveness of the automated system. \nDisparity assessment. Automated systems should be tested using a broad set of measures to assess wheth\u00ad\ner the system components, both in pre-deployment testing and in-context deployment, produce disparities. \nThe demographics of the assessed groups should be as inclusive as possible of race, color, ethnicity, sex \n(including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifi\u00ad\ncation protected by law. The broad set of measures assessed should include demographic performance mea\u00ad\nsures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, and calibration. Demographic data collected for disparity \nassessment should be separated from data used for the automated system and privacy protections should be \ninstituted; in some cases it may make sense to perform such assessment using a data sample. For every \ninstance where the deployed automated system leads to different treatment or impacts disfavoring the identi\u00ad\nfied groups, the entity governing, implementing, or using the system should document the disparity and a \njustification for any continued use of the system. \nDisparity mitigation. When a disparity assessment identifies a disparity against an assessed group, it may \nbe appropriate to take steps to mitigate or eliminate the disparity. In some cases, mitigation or elimination of \nthe disparity may be required by law. \nDisparities that have the potential to lead to algorithmic \ndiscrimination, cause meaningful harm, or violate equity49 goals should be mitigated. When designing and \nevaluating an automated system, steps should be taken to evaluate multiple models and select the one that \nhas the least adverse impact, modify data input choices, or otherwise identify a system with fewer \ndisparities. If adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible, then the use of the automated system \nshould be reconsidered. One of the considerations in whether to use the system should be the validity of any \ntarget measure; unobservable targets may result in the inappropriate use of proxies. Meeting these \nstandards may require instituting mitigation procedures and other protective measures to address \nalgorithmic discrimination, avoid meaningful harm, and achieve equity goals. \nOngoing monitoring and mitigation. Automated systems should be regularly monitored to assess algo\u00ad\nrithmic discrimination that might arise from unforeseen interactions of the system with inequities not \naccounted for during the pre-deployment testing, changes to the system after deployment, or changes to the \ncontext of use or associated data. Monitoring and disparity assessment should be performed by the entity \ndeploying or using the automated system to examine whether the system has led to algorithmic discrimina\u00ad\ntion when deployed. This assessment should be performed regularly and whenever a pattern of unusual \nresults is occurring. It can be performed using a variety of approaches, taking into account whether and how \ndemographic information of impacted people is available, for example via testing with a sample of users or via \nqualitative user experience research. Riskier and higher-impact systems should be monitored and assessed \nmore frequently. Outcomes of this assessment should include additional disparity mitigation, if needed, or \nfallback to earlier procedures in the case that equity standards are no longer met and can't be mitigated, and \nprior mechanisms provide better adherence to equity standards. \n27\nAlgorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections \n",

The Depart\u00ad\nment of Justice has launched a nationwide initiative to combat redlining, which includes reviewing how \nlenders who may be avoiding serving communities of color are conducting targeted marketing and advertising.51 \nThis initiative will draw upon strong partnerships across federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau and prudential regulators. The Action Plan to Advance Property Appraisal and Valuation \nEquity includes a commitment from the agencies that oversee mortgage lending to include a \nnondiscrimination standard in the proposed rules for Automated Valuation Models.52\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice have clearly \nlaid out how employers\u2019 use of AI and other automated systems can result in \ndiscrimination against job applicants and employees with disabilities.53 The documents explain \nhow employers\u2019 use of software that relies on algorithmic decision-making may violate existing requirements \nunder Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d). This technical assistance also provides practical \ntips to employers on how to comply with the ADA, and to job applicants and employees who think that their \nrights may have been violated. \nDisparity assessments identified harms to Black patients' healthcare access. A widely \nused healthcare algorithm relied on the cost of each patient\u2019s past medical care to predict future medical needs, \nrecommending early interventions for the patients deemed most at risk. This process discriminated \nagainst Black patients, who generally have less access to medical care and therefore have generated less cost \nthan white patients with similar illness and need. A landmark study documented this pattern and proposed \npractical ways that were shown to reduce this bias, such as focusing specifically on active chronic health \nconditions or avoidable future costs related to emergency visits and hospitalization.54 \nLarge employers have developed best practices to scrutinize the data and models used \nfor hiring. An industry initiative has developed Algorithmic Bias Safeguards for the Workforce, a structured \nquestionnaire that businesses can use proactively when procuring software to evaluate workers. It covers \nspecific technical questions such as the training data used, model training process, biases identified, and \nmitigation steps employed.55 \nStandards organizations have developed guidelines to incorporate accessibility criteria \ninto technology design processes. The most prevalent in the United States is the Access Board\u2019s Section \n508 regulations,56 which are the technical standards for federal information communication technology (software, \nhardware, and web). Other standards include those issued by the International Organization for \nStandardization,57 and the World Wide Web Consortium Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,58 a globally \nrecognized voluntary consensus standard for web content and other information and communications \ntechnology. \nNIST has released Special Publication 1270, Towards a Standard for Identifying and Managing Bias \nin Artificial Intelligence.59 The special publication: describes the stakes and challenges of bias in artificial \nintelligence and provides examples of how and why it can chip away at public trust; identifies three categories \nof bias in AI \u2013 systemic, statistical, and human \u2013 and describes how and where they contribute to harms; and \ndescribes three broad challenges for mitigating bias \u2013 datasets, testing and evaluation, and human factors \u2013 and \nintroduces preliminary guidance for addressing them. Throughout, the special publication takes a socio-\ntechnical perspective to identifying and managing AI bias. \n29\nAlgorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections \n",

Surveil\u00ad\nlance and data collection, sharing, use, and reuse now sit at the foundation of business models across many industries, \nwith more and more companies tracking the behavior of the American public, building individual profiles based on \nthis data, and using this granular-level information as input into automated systems that further track, profile, and \nimpact the American public. Government agencies, particularly law enforcement agencies, also use and help develop \na variety of technologies that enhance and expand surveillance capabilities, which similarly collect data used as input \ninto other automated systems that directly impact people\u2019s lives. Federal law has not grown to address the expanding \nscale of private data collection, or of the ability of governments at all levels to access that data and leverage the means \nof private collection.  \nMeanwhile, members of the American public are often unable to access their personal data or make critical decisions \nabout its collection and use. Data brokers frequently collect consumer data from numerous sources without \nconsumers\u2019 permission or knowledge.60 Moreover, there is a risk that inaccurate and faulty data can be used to \nmake decisions about their lives, such as whether they will qualify for a loan or get a job. Use of surveillance \ntechnologies has increased in schools and workplaces, and, when coupled with consequential management and \nevaluation decisions, it is leading to mental health harms such as lowered self-confidence, anxiety, depression, and \na reduced ability to use analytical reasoning.61 Documented patterns show that personal data is being aggregated by \ndata brokers to profile communities in harmful ways.62 The impact of all this data harvesting is corrosive, \nbreeding distrust, anxiety, and other mental health problems; chilling speech, protest, and worker organizing; and \nthreatening our democratic process.63 The American public should be protected from these growing risks. \nIncreasingly, some companies are taking these concerns seriously and integrating mechanisms to protect consumer \nprivacy into their products by design and by default, including by minimizing the data they collect, communicating \ncollection and use clearly, and improving security practices. Federal government surveillance and other collection and \nuse of data is governed by legal protections that help to protect civil liberties and provide for limits on data retention \nin some cases. Many states have also enacted consumer data privacy protection regimes to address some of these \nharms. \nHowever, these are not yet standard practices, and the United States lacks a comprehensive statutory or regulatory \nframework governing the rights of the public when it comes to personal data. While a patchwork of laws exists to \nguide the collection and use of personal data in specific contexts, including health, employment, education, and credit, \nit can be unclear how these laws apply in other contexts and in an increasingly automated society. Additional protec\u00ad\ntions would assure the American public that the automated systems they use are not monitoring their activities, \ncollecting information on their lives, or otherwise surveilling them without context-specific consent or legal authori\u00ad\nty. \n31\n",

The American public should be protect\u00ad\ned via built-in privacy protections, data minimization, use and collection limitations, and transparency, in addition \nto being entitled to clear mechanisms to control access to and use of their data\u2014including their metadata\u2014in a \nproactive, informed, and ongoing way. Any automated system collecting, using, sharing, or storing personal data \nshould meet these expectations. \nProtect privacy by design and by default \nPrivacy by design and by default. Automated systems should be designed and built with privacy protect\u00ad\ned by default. Privacy risks should be assessed throughout the development life cycle, including privacy risks \nfrom reidentification, and appropriate technical and policy mitigation measures should be implemented. This \nincludes potential harms to those who are not users of the automated system, but who may be harmed by \ninferred data, purposeful privacy violations, or community surveillance or other community harms. Data \ncollection should be minimized and clearly communicated to the people whose data is collected. Data should \nonly be collected or used for the purposes of training or testing machine learning models if such collection and \nuse is legal and consistent with the expectations of the people whose data is collected. User experience \nresearch should be conducted to confirm that people understand what data is being collected about them and \nhow it will be used, and that this collection matches their expectations and desires. \nData collection and use-case scope limits. Data collection should be limited in scope, with specific, \nnarrow identified goals, to avoid \"mission creep.\"  Anticipated data collection should be determined to be \nstrictly necessary to the identified goals and should be minimized as much as possible. Data collected based on \nthese identified goals and for a specific context should not be used in a different context without assessing for \nnew privacy risks and implementing appropriate mitigation measures, which may include express consent. \nClear timelines for data retention should be established, with data deleted as soon as possible in accordance \nwith legal or policy-based limitations. Determined data retention timelines should be documented and justi\u00ad\nfied. \nRisk identification and mitigation. Entities that collect, use, share, or store sensitive data should \nattempt to proactively identify harms and seek to manage them so as to avoid, mitigate, and respond appropri\u00ad\nately to identified risks. Appropriate responses include determining not to process data when the privacy risks \noutweigh the benefits or implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. Appropriate responses do not \ninclude sharing or transferring the privacy risks to users via notice or consent requests where users could not \nreasonably be expected to understand the risks without further support. \nPrivacy-preserving security. Entities creating, using, or governing automated systems should follow \nprivacy and security best practices designed to ensure data and metadata do not leak beyond the specific \nconsented use case. Best practices could include using privacy-enhancing cryptography or other types of \nprivacy-enhancing technologies or fine-grained permissions and access control mechanisms, along with \nconventional system security protocols. \n33\n",

Surveillance or monitoring systems should be subject to \nheightened oversight that includes at a minimum assessment of potential harms during design (before deploy\u00ad\nment) and in an ongoing manner, to ensure that the American public\u2019s rights, opportunities, and access are \nprotected. This assessment should be done before deployment and should give special attention to ensure \nthere is not algorithmic discrimination, especially based on community membership, when deployed in a \nspecific real-world context. Such assessment should then be reaffirmed in an ongoing manner as long as the \nsystem is in use. \nLimited and proportionate surveillance. Surveillance should be avoided unless it is strictly necessary \nto achieve a legitimate purpose and it is proportionate to the need. Designers, developers, and deployers of \nsurveillance systems should use the least invasive means of monitoring available and restrict monitoring to the \nminimum number of subjects possible. To the greatest extent possible consistent with law enforcement and \nnational security needs, individuals subject to monitoring should be provided with clear and specific notice \nbefore it occurs and be informed about how the data gathered through surveillance will be used. \nScope limits on surveillance to protect rights and democratic values. Civil liberties and civil \nrights must not be limited by the threat of surveillance or harassment facilitated or aided by an automated \nsystem. Surveillance systems should not be used to monitor the exercise of democratic rights, such as voting, \nprivacy, peaceful assembly, speech, or association, in a way that limits the exercise of civil rights or civil liber\u00ad\nties. Information about or algorithmically-determined assumptions related to identity should be carefully \nlimited if used to target or guide surveillance systems in order to avoid algorithmic discrimination; such iden\u00ad\ntity-related information includes group characteristics or affiliations, geographic designations, location-based \nand association-based inferences, social networks, and biometrics. Continuous surveillance and monitoring \nsystems should not be used in physical or digital workplaces (regardless of employment status), public educa\u00ad\ntional institutions, and public accommodations. Continuous surveillance and monitoring systems should not \nbe used in a way that has the effect of limiting access to critical resources or services or suppressing the exer\u00ad\ncise of rights, even where the organization is not under a particular duty to protect those rights. \nProvide the public with mechanisms for appropriate and meaningful consent, access, and \ncontrol over their data \nUse-specific consent. Consent practices should not allow for abusive surveillance practices. Where data \ncollectors or automated systems seek consent, they should seek it for specific, narrow use contexts, for specif\u00ad\nic time durations, and for use by specific entities. Consent should not extend if any of these conditions change; \nconsent should be re-acquired before using data if the use case changes, a time limit elapses, or data is trans\u00ad\nferred to another entity (including being shared or sold). Consent requested should be limited in scope and \nshould not request consent beyond what is required. Refusal to provide consent should be allowed, without \nadverse effects, to the greatest extent possible based on the needs of the use case. \nBrief and direct consent requests. When seeking consent from users short, plain language consent \nrequests should be used so that users understand for what use contexts, time span, and entities they are \nproviding data and metadata consent. User experience research should be performed to ensure these consent \nrequests meet performance standards for readability and comprehension. This includes ensuring that consent \nrequests are accessible to users with disabilities and are available in the language(s) and reading level appro\u00ad\npriate for the audience.  User experience design choices that intentionally obfuscate or manipulate user \nchoice (i.e., \u201cdark patterns\u201d) should be not be used. \n34\n",

This is due to the intimate nature of these \ndomains as well as the inability of individuals to opt out of these domains in any meaningful way, and the \nhistorical discrimination that has often accompanied data knowledge.69 Domains understood by the public to be \nsensitive also change over time, including because of technological developments. Tracking and monitoring \ntechnologies, personal tracking devices, and our extensive data footprints are used and misused more than ever \nbefore; as such, the protections afforded by current legal guidelines may be inadequate. The American public \ndeserves assurances that data related to such sensitive domains is protected and used appropriately and only in \nnarrowly defined contexts with clear benefits to the individual and/or society. \nTo this end, automated systems that collect, use, share, or store data related to these sensitive domains should meet \nadditional expectations. Data and metadata are sensitive if they pertain to an individual in a sensitive domain (defined \nbelow); are generated by technologies used in a sensitive domain; can be used to infer data from a sensitive domain or \nsensitive data about an individual (such as disability-related data, genomic data, biometric data, behavioral data, \ngeolocation data, data related to interaction with the criminal justice system, relationship history and legal status such \nas custody and divorce information, and home, work, or school environmental data); or have the reasonable potential \nto be used in ways that are likely to expose individuals to meaningful harm, such as a loss of privacy or financial harm \ndue to identity theft. Data and metadata generated by or about those who are not yet legal adults is also sensitive, even \nif not related to a sensitive domain.

In the context of this framework, such domains are considered \nsensitive whether or not the specifics of a system context would necessitate coverage under existing law, and domains \nand data that are considered sensitive are understood to change over time based on societal norms and context. \n36\n",

Depending on the technological use case and \nbased on an ethical assessment, consent for sensitive data may need to be acquired from a guardian and/or child. \nProvide enhanced protections for data related to sensitive domains \nNecessary functions only. Sensitive data should only be used for functions strictly necessary for that \ndomain or for functions that are required for administrative reasons (e.g., school attendance records), unless \nconsent is acquired, if appropriate, and the additional expectations in this section are met. Consent for non-\nnecessary functions should be optional, i.e., should not be required, incentivized, or coerced in order to \nreceive opportunities or access to services. In cases where data is provided to an entity (e.g., health insurance \ncompany) in order to facilitate payment for such a need, that data should only be used for that purpose. \nEthical review and use prohibitions. Any use of sensitive data or decision process based in part on sensi-\ntive data that might limit rights, opportunities, or access, whether the decision is automated or not, should go \nthrough a thorough ethical review and monitoring, both in advance and by periodic review (e.g., via an indepen-\ndent ethics committee or similarly robust process). In some cases, this ethical review may determine that data \nshould not be used or shared for specific uses even with consent. Some novel uses of automated systems in this \ncontext, where the algorithm is dynamically developing and where the science behind the use case is not well \nestablished, may also count as human subject experimentation, and require special review under organizational \ncompliance bodies applying medical, scientific, and academic human subject experimentation ethics rules and \ngovernance procedures. \nData quality. In sensitive domains, entities should be especially careful to maintain the quality of data to \navoid adverse consequences arising from decision-making based on flawed or inaccurate data. Such care is \nnecessary in a fragmented, complex data ecosystem and for datasets that have limited access such as for fraud \nprevention and law enforcement. It should be not left solely to individuals to carry the burden of reviewing and \ncorrecting data. Entities should conduct regular, independent audits and take prompt corrective measures to \nmaintain accurate, timely, and complete data. \nLimit access to sensitive data and derived data. Sensitive data and derived data should not be sold, \nshared, or made public as part of data brokerage or other agreements. Sensitive data includes data that can be \nused to infer sensitive information; even systems that are not directly marketed as sensitive domain technologies \nare expected to keep sensitive data private. Access to such data should be limited based on necessity and based \non a principle of local control, such that those individuals closest to the data subject have more access while \nthose who are less proximate do not (e.g., a teacher has access to their students\u2019 daily progress data while a \nsuperintendent does not). \nReporting. In addition to the reporting on data privacy (as listed above for non-sensitive data), entities devel-\noping technologies related to a sensitive domain and those collecting, using, storing, or sharing sensitive data \nshould, whenever appropriate, regularly provide public reports describing: any data security lapses or breaches \nthat resulted in sensitive data leaks; the number, type, and outcomes of ethical pre-reviews undertaken; a \ndescription of any data sold, shared, or made public, and how that data was assessed to determine it did not pres-\nent a sensitive data risk; and ongoing risk identification and management procedures, and any mitigation added \nbased on these procedures.

Among other things, the Privacy Act limits the storage of individual \ninformation in federal systems of records, illustrating the principle of limiting the scope of data retention. Under \nthe Privacy Act, federal agencies may only retain data about an individual that is \u201crelevant and necessary\u201d to \naccomplish an agency\u2019s statutory purpose or to comply with an Executive Order of the President. The law allows \nfor individuals to be able to access any of their individual information stored in a federal system of records, if not \nincluded under one of the systems of records exempted pursuant to the Privacy Act. In these cases, federal agen\u00ad\ncies must provide a method for an individual to determine if their personal information is stored in a particular \nsystem of records, and must provide procedures for an individual to contest the contents of a record about them. \nFurther, the Privacy Act allows for a cause of action for an individual to seek legal relief if a federal agency does not \ncomply with the Privacy Act\u2019s requirements. Among other things, a court may order a federal agency to amend or \ncorrect an individual\u2019s information in its records or award monetary damages if an inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, \nor incomplete record results in an adverse determination about an individual\u2019s \u201cqualifications, character, rights, \u2026 \nopportunities\u2026, or benefits.\u201d \nNIST\u2019s Privacy Framework provides a comprehensive, detailed and actionable approach for \norganizations to manage privacy risks. The NIST Framework gives organizations ways to identify and \ncommunicate their privacy risks and goals to support ethical decision-making in system, product, and service \ndesign or deployment, as well as the measures they are taking to demonstrate compliance with applicable laws \nor regulations. It has been voluntarily adopted by organizations across many different sectors around the world.78\nA school board\u2019s attempt to surveil public school students\u2014undertaken without \nadequate community input\u2014sparked a state-wide biometrics moratorium.79 Reacting to a plan in \nthe city of Lockport, New York, the state\u2019s legislature banned the use of facial recognition systems and other \n\u201cbiometric identifying technology\u201d in schools until July 1, 2022.80 The law additionally requires that a report on \nthe privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties implications of the use of such technologies be issued before \nbiometric identification technologies can be used in New York schools. \nFederal law requires employers, and any consultants they may retain, to report the costs \nof surveilling employees in the context of a labor dispute, providing a transparency \nmechanism to help protect worker organizing. Employers engaging in workplace surveillance \"where \nan object there-of, directly or indirectly, is [\u2026] to obtain information concerning the activities of employees or a \nlabor organization in connection with a labor dispute\" must report expenditures relating to this surveillance to \nthe Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards, and consultants who employers retain for \nthese purposes must also file reports regarding their activities.81\nPrivacy choices on smartphones show that when technologies are well designed, privacy \nand data agency can be meaningful and not overwhelming. These choices\u2014such as contextual, timely \nalerts about location tracking\u2014are brief, direct, and use-specific. Many of the expectations listed here for \nprivacy by design and use-specific consent mirror those distributed to developers as best practices when \ndeveloping for smart phone devices,82 such as being transparent about how user data will be used, asking for app \npermissions during their use so that the use-context will be clear to users, and ensuring that the app will still \nwork if users deny (or later revoke) some permissions. \n39\n",

But this \nexpansive impact is not always visible. An applicant might not know whether a person rejected their resume or a \nhiring algorithm moved them to the bottom of the list. A defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge deny\u00ad\ning their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them \u201chigh risk.\u201d From correcting errors to contesting \ndecisions, people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives. \nNotice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose, allowing experts to verify the reasonable\u00ad\nness of a recommendation before enacting it. \nIn order to guard against potential harms, the American public needs to know if an automated system is being used. \nClear, brief, and understandable notice is a prerequisite for achieving the other protections in this framework. Like\u00ad\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a \nparticular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, \nunaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and \nmore important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted \nby those choices. In the context of automated systems, clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline \nrequirement. \nProviding notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, \nmaking a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such \nas credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the \nprocess of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many \nforms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory \nsystems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public \ndeserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, \nopportunities, or access. This knowledge should provide confidence in how the public is being treated, and trust in the \nvalidity and reasonable use of automated systems. \n\u2022\nA lawyer representing an older client with disabilities who had been cut off from Medicaid-funded home\nhealth-care assistance couldn't determine why, especially since the decision went against historical access\npractices. In a court hearing, the lawyer learned from a witness that the state in which the older client\nlived had recently adopted a new algorithm to determine eligibility.83 The lack of a timely explanation made it\nharder to understand and contest the decision.\n\u2022\nA formal child welfare investigation is opened against a parent based on an algorithm and without the parent\never being notified that data was being collected and used as part of an algorithmic child maltreatment\nrisk assessment.84 The lack of notice or an explanation makes it harder for those performing child\nmaltreatment assessments to validate the risk assessment and denies parents knowledge that could help them\ncontest a decision.\n41\n",

The Biometric Information Privacy Act enacted by the state contains a number of provisions \nconcerning the use of individual biometric data and identifiers. Included among them is a provision that no private \nentity may \"collect, capture, purchase, receive through trade, or otherwise obtain\" such information about an \nindividual, unless written notice is provided to that individual or their legally appointed representative. 87\nMajor technology companies are piloting new ways to communicate with the public about \ntheir automated technologies. For example, a collection of non-profit organizations and companies have \nworked together to develop a framework that defines operational approaches to transparency for machine \nlearning systems.88 This framework, and others like it,89 inform the public about the use of these tools, going \nbeyond simple notice to include reporting elements such as safety evaluations, disparity assessments, and \nexplanations of how the systems work. \nLenders are required by federal law to notify consumers about certain decisions made about \nthem. Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act require in certain circumstances \nthat consumers who are denied credit receive \"adverse action\" notices. Anyone who relies on the information in a \ncredit report to deny a consumer credit must, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, provide an \"adverse action\" \nnotice to the consumer, which includes \"notice of the reasons a creditor took adverse action on the application \nor on an existing credit account.\"90 In addition, under the risk-based pricing rule,91 lenders must either inform \nborrowers of their credit score, or else tell consumers when \"they are getting worse terms because of \ninformation in their credit report.\" The CFPB has also asserted that \"[t]he law gives every applicant the right to \na specific explanation if their application for credit was denied, and that right is not diminished simply because \na company uses a complex algorithm that it doesn't understand.\"92 Such explanations illustrate a shared value \nthat certain decisions need to be explained. \nA California law requires that warehouse employees are provided with notice and explana-\ntion about quotas, potentially facilitated by automated systems, that apply to them. Warehous-\ning employers in California that use quota systems (often facilitated by algorithmic monitoring systems) are \nrequired to provide employees with a written description of each quota that applies to the employee, including \n\u201cquantified number of tasks to be performed or materials to be produced or handled, within the defined \ntime period, and any potential adverse employment action that could result from failure to meet the quota.\u201d93\nAcross the federal government, agencies are conducting and supporting research on explain-\nable AI systems. The NIST is conducting fundamental research on the explainability of AI systems. A multidis-\nciplinary team of researchers aims to develop measurement methods and best practices to support the \nimplementation of core tenets of explainable AI.94 The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has a \nprogram on Explainable Artificial Intelligence that aims to create a suite of machine learning techniques that \nproduce more explainable models, while maintaining a high level of learning performance (prediction \naccuracy), and enable human users to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging \ngeneration of artificially intelligent partners.95 The National Science Foundation\u2019s program on Fairness in \nArtificial Intelligence also includes a specific interest in research foundations for explainable AI.96\n45\n",

Yet members of the public are often \npresented with no alternative, or are forced to endure a cumbersome process to reach a human decision-maker once \nthey decide they no longer want to deal exclusively with the automated system or be impacted by its results. As a result \nof this lack of human reconsideration, many receive delayed access, or lose access, to rights, opportunities, benefits, \nand critical services. The American public deserves the assurance that, when rights, opportunities, or access are \nmeaningfully at stake and there is a reasonable expectation of an alternative to an automated system, they can conve\u00ad\nniently opt out of an automated system and will not be disadvantaged for that choice. In some cases, such a human or \nother alternative may be required by law, for example it could be required as \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for people \nwith disabilities. \nIn addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative, the American public deserves a human fallback \nsystem in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm. No matter how rigorously an automated system is \ntested, there will always be situations for which the system fails. The American public deserves protection via human \nreview against these outlying or unexpected scenarios. In the case of time-critical systems, the public should not have \nto wait\u2014immediate human consideration and fallback should be available. In many time-critical systems, such a \nremedy is already immediately available, such as a building manager who can open a door in the case an automated \ncard access system fails. \nIn the criminal justice system, employment, education, healthcare, and other sensitive domains, automated systems \nare used for many purposes, from pre-trial risk assessments and parole decisions to technologies that help doctors \ndiagnose disease. Absent appropriate safeguards, these technologies can lead to unfair, inaccurate, or dangerous \noutcomes. These sensitive domains require extra protections. It is critically important that there is extensive human \noversight in such settings. \nThese critical protections have been adopted in some scenarios. Where automated systems have been introduced to \nprovide the public access to government benefits, existing human paper and phone-based processes are generally still \nin place, providing an important alternative to ensure access. Companies that have introduced automated call centers \noften retain the option of dialing zero to reach an operator. When automated identity controls are in place to board an \nairplane or enter the country, there is a person supervising the systems who can be turned to for help or to appeal a \nmisidentification. \nThe American people deserve the reassurance that such procedures are in place to protect their rights, opportunities, \nand access. People make mistakes, and a human alternative or fallback mechanism will not always have the right \nanswer, but they serve as an important check on the power and validity of automated systems. \n\u2022 An automated signature matching system is used as part of the voting process in many parts of the country to\ndetermine whether the signature on a mail-in ballot matches the signature on file. These signature matching\nsystems are less likely to work correctly for some voters, including voters with mental or physical\ndisabilities, voters with shorter or hyphenated names, and voters who have changed their name.97 A human\ncuring process,98 which helps voters to confirm their signatures and correct other voting mistakes, is\nimportant to ensure all votes are counted,99 and it is already standard practice in much of the country for\nboth an election official and the voter to have the opportunity to review and correct any such issues.100 \n47\n",

Consideration should be given to ensuring outcomes of the fallback and escalation system are \nequitable when compared to those of the automated system and such that the fallback and escalation \nsystem provides equitable access to underserved communities.105 \nTimely. Human consideration and fallback are only useful if they are conducted and concluded in a \ntimely manner. The determination of what is timely should be made relative to the specific automated \nsystem, and the review system should be staffed and regularly assessed to ensure it is providing timely \nconsideration and fallback. In time-critical systems, this mechanism should be immediately available or, \nwhere possible, available before the harm occurs. Time-critical systems include, but are not limited to, \nvoting-related systems, automated building access and other access systems, systems that form a critical \ncomponent of healthcare, and systems that have the ability to withhold wages or otherwise cause \nimmediate financial penalties. \nEffective. The organizational structure surrounding processes for consideration and fallback should \nbe designed so that if the human decision-maker charged with reassessing a decision determines that it \nshould be overruled, the new decision will be effectively enacted. This includes ensuring that the new \ndecision is entered into the automated system throughout its components, any previous repercussions from \nthe old decision are also overturned, and safeguards are put in place to help ensure that future decisions do \nnot result in the same errors. \nMaintained.

Anyone administering, interacting with, or interpreting the outputs of an auto\u00ad\nmated system should receive training in that system, including how to properly interpret outputs of a system \nin light of its intended purpose and in how to mitigate the effects of automation bias. The training should reoc\u00ad\ncur regularly to ensure it is up to date with the system and to ensure the system is used appropriately. Assess\u00ad\nment should be ongoing to ensure that the use of the system with human involvement provides for appropri\u00ad\nate results, i.e., that the involvement of people does not invalidate the system's assessment as safe and effective \nor lead to algorithmic discrimination. \nOversight. Human-based systems have the potential for bias, including automation bias, as well as other \nconcerns that may limit their effectiveness. The results of assessments of the efficacy and potential bias of \nsuch human-based systems should be overseen by governance structures that have the potential to update the \noperation of the human-based system in order to mitigate these effects. \n50\n",

Additionally, automated systems used within \nsensitive domains should meet these expectations: \nNarrowly scoped data and inferences. Human oversight should ensure that automated systems in \nsensitive domains are narrowly scoped to address a defined goal, justifying each included data item or attri\u00ad\nbute as relevant to the specific use case. Data included should be carefully limited to avoid algorithmic \ndiscrimination resulting from, e.g., use of community characteristics, social network analysis, or group-based \ninferences. \nTailored to the situation. Human oversight should ensure that automated systems in sensitive domains \nare tailored to the specific use case and real-world deployment scenario, and evaluation testing should show \nthat the system is safe and effective for that specific situation. Validation testing performed based on one loca\u00ad\ntion or use case should not be assumed to transfer to another. \nHuman consideration before any high-risk decision. Automated systems, where they are used in \nsensitive domains, may play a role in directly providing information or otherwise providing positive outcomes \nto impacted people. However, automated systems should not be allowed to directly intervene in high-risk \nsituations, such as sentencing decisions or medical care, without human consideration. \nMeaningful access to examine the system. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated \nsystems should consider limited waivers of confidentiality (including those related to trade secrets) where \nnecessary in order to provide meaningful oversight of systems used in sensitive domains, incorporating mea\u00ad\nsures to protect intellectual property and trade secrets from unwarranted disclosure as appropriate. This \nincludes (potentially private and protected) meaningful access to source code, documentation, and related \ndata during any associated legal discovery, subject to effective confidentiality or court orders. Such meaning\u00ad\nful access should include (but is not limited to) adhering to the principle on Notice and Explanation using the \nhighest level of risk so the system is designed with built-in explanations; such systems should use fully-trans\u00ad\nparent models where the model itself can be understood by people needing to directly examine it. \nDemonstrate access to human alternatives, consideration, and fallback \nReporting. Reporting should include an assessment of timeliness and the extent of additional burden for \nhuman alternatives, aggregate statistics about who chooses the human alternative, along with the results of \nthe assessment about brevity, clarity, and accessibility of notice and opt-out instructions. Reporting on the \naccessibility, timeliness, and effectiveness of human consideration and fallback should be made public at regu\u00ad\nlar intervals for as long as the system is in use. This should include aggregated information about the number \nand type of requests for consideration, fallback employed, and any repeated requests; the timeliness of the \nhandling of these requests, including mean wait times for different types of requests as well as maximum wait \ntimes; and information about the procedures used to address requests for consideration along with the results \nof the evaluation of their accessibility. For systems used in sensitive domains, reporting should include infor\u00ad\nmation about training and governance procedures for these technologies. Reporting should also include docu\u00ad\nmentation of goals and assessment of meeting those goals, consideration of data included, and documentation \nof the governance of reasonable access to the technology.

They individually noted that while AI technologies may be new, the process of \ntechnological diffusion is not, and that it was critical to have thoughtful and responsible development and \nintegration of technology within communities. Some panelists suggested that the integration of technology \ncould benefit from examining how technological diffusion has worked in the realm of urban planning: \nlessons learned from successes and failures there include the importance of balancing ownership rights, use \nrights, and community health, safety and welfare, as well ensuring better representation of all voices, \nespecially those traditionally marginalized by technological advances. Some panelists also raised the issue of \npower structures \u2013 providing examples of how strong transparency requirements in smart city projects \nhelped to reshape power and give more voice to those lacking the financial or political power to effect change. \nIn discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms \nof these technologies, various panelists emphasized the need for transparency, data collection, and \nflexible and reactive policy development, analogous to how software is continuously updated and deployed. \nSome panelists pointed out that companies need clear guidelines to have a consistent environment for \ninnovation, with principles and guardrails being the key to fostering responsible innovation. \nPanel 2: The Criminal Justice System. This event explored current and emergent uses of technology in \nthe criminal justice system and considered how they advance or undermine public safety, justice, and \ndemocratic values. \nWelcome: \n\u2022\nSuresh Venkatasubramanian, Assistant Director for Science and Justice, White House Office of Science\nand Technology Policy\n\u2022\nBen Winters, Counsel, Electronic Privacy Information Center\nModerator: Chiraag Bains, Deputy Assistant to the President on Racial Justice & Equity \nPanelists: \n\u2022\nSean Malinowski, Director of Policing Innovation and Reform, University of Chicago Crime Lab\n\u2022\nKristian Lum, Researcher\n\u2022\nJumana Musa, Director, Fourth Amendment Center, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\n\u2022\nStanley Andrisse, Executive Director, From Prison Cells to PHD; Assistant Professor, Howard University\nCollege of Medicine\n\u2022\nMyaisha Hayes, Campaign Strategies Director, MediaJustice\nPanelists discussed uses of technology within the criminal justice system, including the use of predictive \npolicing, pretrial risk assessments, automated license plate readers, and prison communication tools. The \ndiscussion emphasized that communities deserve safety, and strategies need to be identified that lead to safety; \nsuch strategies might include data-driven approaches, but the focus on safety should be primary, and \ntechnology may or may not be part of an effective set of mechanisms to achieve safety. Various panelists raised \nconcerns about the validity of these systems, the tendency of adverse or irrelevant data to lead to a replication of \nunjust outcomes, and the confirmation bias and tendency of people to defer to potentially inaccurate automated \nsystems. Throughout, many of the panelists individually emphasized that the impact of these systems on \nindividuals and communities is potentially severe: the systems lack individualization and work against the \nbelief that people can change for the better, system use can lead to the loss of jobs and custody of children, and \nsurveillance can lead to chilling effects for communities and sends negative signals to community members \nabout how they're viewed. \nIn discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of \nthese technologies, various panelists emphasized that transparency is important but is not enough to achieve \naccountability. Some panelists discussed their individual views on additional system needs for validity, and \nagreed upon the importance of advisory boards and compensated community input early in the design process \n(before the technology is built and instituted). Various panelists also emphasized the importance of regulation \nthat includes limits to the type and cost of such technologies. \n56\n",

Education-related \nconcerning uses included the increased use of remote proctoring systems, student location and facial \nrecognition tracking, teacher evaluation systems, robot teachers, and more. Housing-related concerning uses \nincluding automated tenant background screening and facial recognition-based controls to enter or exit \nhousing complexes. Employment-related concerning uses included discrimination in automated hiring \nscreening and workplace surveillance. Various panelists raised the limitations of existing privacy law as a key \nconcern, pointing out that students should be able to reinvent themselves and require privacy of their student \nrecords and education-related data in order to do so. The overarching concerns of surveillance in these \ndomains included concerns about the chilling effects of surveillance on student expression, inappropriate \ncontrol of tenants via surveillance, and the way that surveillance of workers blurs the boundary between work \nand life and exerts extreme and potentially damaging control over workers' lives. Additionally, some panelists \npointed out ways that data from one situation was misapplied in another in a way that limited people's \nopportunities, for example data from criminal justice settings or previous evictions being used to block further \naccess to housing. Throughout, various panelists emphasized that these technologies are being used to shift the \nburden of oversight and efficiency from employers to workers, schools to students, and landlords to tenants, in \nways that diminish and encroach on equality of opportunity; assessment of these technologies should include \nwhether they are genuinely helpful in solving an identified problem. \nIn discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of \nthese technologies, panelists individually described the importance of: receiving community input into the \ndesign and use of technologies, public reporting on crucial elements of these systems, better notice and consent \nprocedures that ensure privacy based on context and use case, ability to opt-out of using these systems and \nreceive a fallback to a human process, providing explanations of decisions and how these systems work, the \nneed for governance including training in using these systems, ensuring the technological use cases are \ngenuinely related to the goal task and are locally validated to work, and the need for institution and protection \nof third party audits to ensure systems continue to be accountable and valid. \n57\n",

AI RMF pro\ufb01les assist organizations in deciding how to \nbest manage AI risks in a manner that is well-aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory \nrequirements and best practices, and re\ufb02ects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF \npro\ufb01les, this pro\ufb01le o\ufb00ers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle \nand for GAI as a technology.  \nAs GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document \nis an AI RMF cross-sectoral pro\ufb01le. Cross-sectoral pro\ufb01les can be used to govern, map, measure, and \nmanage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors, such as the use of \nlarge language models (LLMs), cloud-based services, or acquisition. \nThis document de\ufb01nes risks that are novel to or exacerbated by the use of GAI. After introducing and \ndescribing these risks, the document provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations govern, \nmap, measure, and manage these risks. \n \n \n1 EO 14110 de\ufb01nes Generative AI as \u201cthe class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input \ndata in order to generate derived synthetic content. This can include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital \ncontent.\u201d While not all GAI is derived from foundation models, for purposes of this document, GAI generally refers \nto generative foundation models. The foundation model subcategory of \u201cdual-use foundation models\u201d is de\ufb01ned by \nEO 14110 as \u201can AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of \nbillions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of contexts.\u201d  \n2 This pro\ufb01le was developed per Section 4.1(a)(i)(A) of EO 14110, which directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting \nthrough the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to develop a companion \nresource to the AI RMF, NIST AI 100\u20131, for generative AI. \n",

The GAI PWG was an open, transparent, and collaborative \nprocess, facilitated via a virtual workspace, to obtain multistakeholder input on GAI risk management and to \ninform NIST\u2019s approach. \nThe focus of the GAI PWG was limited to four primary considerations relevant to GAI: Governance, Content \nProvenance, Pre-deployment Testing, and Incident Disclosure (further described in Appendix A). As such, the \nsuggested actions in this document primarily address these considerations. \nFuture revisions of this pro\ufb01le will include additional AI RMF subcategories, risks, and suggested actions based \non additional considerations of GAI as the space evolves and empirical evidence indicates additional risks. A \nglossary of terms pertinent to GAI risk management will be developed and hosted on NIST\u2019s Trustworthy & \nResponsible AI Resource Center (AIRC), and added to The Language of Trustworthy AI: An In-Depth Glossary of \nTerms. \nThis document was also informed by public comments and consultations from several Requests for Information. \n \n2. \nOverview of Risks Unique to or Exacerbated by GAI \nIn the context of the AI RMF, risk refers to the composite measure of an event\u2019s probability (or \nlikelihood) of occurring and the magnitude or degree of the consequences of the corresponding event. \nSome risks can be assessed as likely to materialize in a given context, particularly those that have been \nempirically demonstrated in similar contexts. Other risks may be unlikely to materialize in a given \ncontext, or may be more speculative and therefore uncertain. \nAI risks can di\ufb00er from or intensify traditional software risks. Likewise, GAI can exacerbate existing AI \nrisks, and creates unique risks. GAI risks can vary along many dimensions: \n\u2022 \nStage of the AI lifecycle: Risks can arise during design, development, deployment, operation, \nand/or decommissioning. \n\u2022 \nScope: Risks may exist at individual model or system levels, at the application or implementation \nlevels (i.e., for a speci\ufb01c use case), or at the ecosystem level \u2013 that is, beyond a single system or \norganizational context. Examples of the latter include the expansion of \u201calgorithmic \nmonocultures,3\u201d resulting from repeated use of the same model, or impacts on access to \nopportunity, labor markets, and the creative economies.4 \n\u2022 \nSource of risk: Risks may emerge from factors related to the design, training, or operation of the \nGAI model itself, stemming in some cases from GAI model or system inputs, and in other cases, \nfrom GAI system outputs. Many GAI risks, however, originate from human behavior, including \n \n \n3 \u201cAlgorithmic monocultures\u201d refers to the phenomenon in which repeated use of the same model or algorithm in \nconsequential decision-making settings like employment and lending can result in increased susceptibility by \nsystems to correlated failures (like unexpected shocks), due to multiple actors relying on the same algorithm.  \n4 Many studies have projected the impact of AI on the workforce and labor markets. Fewer studies have examined \nthe impact of GAI on the labor market, though some industry surveys indicate that that both employees and \nemployers are pondering this disruption.  \n",

They may \nadditionally wish to allocate risk management resources relative to the severity and likelihood of \nnegative impacts, including where and how these risks manifest, and their direct and material impacts \nharms in the context of GAI use. Mitigations for model or system level risks may di\ufb00er from mitigations \nfor use-case or ecosystem level risks. \nImportantly, some GAI risks are unknown, and are therefore di\ufb03cult to properly scope or evaluate given \nthe uncertainty about potential GAI scale, complexity, and capabilities. Other risks may be known but \ndi\ufb03cult to estimate given the wide range of GAI stakeholders, uses, inputs, and outputs. Challenges with \nrisk estimation are aggravated by a lack of visibility into GAI training data, and the generally immature \nstate of the science of AI measurement and safety today. This document focuses on risks for which there \nis an existing empirical evidence base at the time this pro\ufb01le was written; for example, speculative risks \nthat may potentially arise in more advanced, future GAI systems are not considered. Future updates may \nincorporate additional risks or provide further details on the risks identi\ufb01ed below. \nTo guide organizations in identifying and managing GAI risks, a set of risks unique to or exacerbated by \nthe development and use of GAI are de\ufb01ned below.5 Each risk is labeled according to the outcome, \nobject, or source of the risk (i.e., some are risks \u201cto\u201d a subject or domain and others are risks \u201cof\u201d or \n\u201cfrom\u201d an issue or theme). These risks provide a lens through which organizations can frame and execute \nrisk management e\ufb00orts. To help streamline risk management e\ufb00orts, each risk is mapped in Section 3 \n(as well as in tables in Appendix B) to relevant Trustworthy AI Characteristics identi\ufb01ed in the AI RMF.  \n \n \n5 These risks can be further categorized by organizations depending on their unique approaches to risk de\ufb01nition \nand management. One possible way to further categorize these risks, derived in part from the UK\u2019s International \nScienti\ufb01c Report on the Safety of Advanced AI, could be: 1) Technical / Model risks (or risk from malfunction): \nConfabulation; Dangerous or Violent Recommendations; Data Privacy; Value Chain and Component Integration; \nHarmful Bias, and Homogenization; 2) Misuse by humans (or malicious use): CBRN Information or Capabilities; \nData Privacy; Human-AI Con\ufb01guration; Obscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content; Information Integrity; \nInformation Security; 3) Ecosystem / societal risks (or systemic risks): Data Privacy; Environmental; Intellectual \nProperty. We also note that some risks are cross-cutting between these categories.  \n",

Confabulation \n\u201cConfabulation\u201d refers to a phenomenon in which GAI systems generate and con\ufb01dently present \nerroneous or false content in response to prompts. Confabulations also include generated outputs that \ndiverge from the prompts or other input or that contradict previously generated statements in the same \ncontext. These phenomena are colloquially also referred to as \u201challucinations\u201d or \u201cfabrications.\u201d \nConfabulations can occur across GAI outputs and contexts.9,10 Confabulations are a natural result of the \nway generative models are designed: they generate outputs that approximate the statistical distribution \nof their training data; for example, LLMs predict the next token or word in a sentence or phrase. While \nsuch statistical prediction can produce factually accurate and consistent outputs, it can also produce \noutputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent. This dynamic is particularly relevant when \nit comes to open-ended prompts for long-form responses and in domains which require highly \ncontextual and/or domain expertise.  \nRisks from confabulations may arise when users believe false content \u2013 often due to the con\ufb01dent nature \nof the response \u2013 leading users to act upon or promote the false information. This poses a challenge for \nmany real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where a confabulated summary of patient \ninformation reports could cause doctors to make incorrect diagnoses and/or recommend the wrong \ntreatments. Risks of confabulated content may be especially important to monitor when integrating GAI \ninto applications involving consequential decision making. \nGAI outputs may also include confabulated logic or citations that purport to justify or explain the \nsystem\u2019s answer, which may further mislead humans into inappropriately trusting the system\u2019s output. \nFor instance, LLMs sometimes provide logical steps for how they arrived at an answer even when the \nanswer itself is incorrect. Similarly, an LLM could falsely assert that it is human or has human traits, \npotentially deceiving humans into believing they are speaking with another human. \nThe extent to which humans can be deceived by LLMs, the mechanisms by which this may occur, and the \npotential risks from adversarial prompting of such behavior are emerging areas of study.

Similar concerns are present for other GAI media, including \nvideo and audio. GAI may also produce content that recommends self-harm or criminal/illegal activities.  \nMany current systems restrict model outputs to limit certain content or in response to certain prompts, \nbut this approach may still produce harmful recommendations in response to other less-explicit, novel \nprompts (also relevant to CBRN Information or Capabilities, Data Privacy, Information Security, and \nObscene, Degrading and/or Abusive Content). Crafting such prompts deliberately is known as \n\u201cjailbreaking,\u201d or, manipulating prompts to circumvent output controls. Limitations of GAI systems can be \nharmful or dangerous in certain contexts. Studies have observed that users may disclose mental health \nissues in conversations with chatbots \u2013 and that users exhibit negative reactions to unhelpful responses \nfrom these chatbots during situations of distress. \nThis risk encompasses di\ufb03culty controlling creation of and public exposure to o\ufb00ensive or hateful \nlanguage, and denigrating or stereotypical content generated by AI. This kind of speech may contribute \nto downstream harm such as fueling dangerous or violent behaviors. The spread of denigrating or \nstereotypical content can also further exacerbate representational harms (see Harmful Bias and \nHomogenization below).  \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Safe, Secure and Resilient \n2.4. Data Privacy \nGAI systems raise several risks to privacy. GAI system training requires large volumes of data, which in \nsome cases may include personal data. The use of personal data for GAI training raises risks to widely \naccepted privacy principles, including to transparency, individual participation (including consent), and \npurpose speci\ufb01cation. For example, most model developers do not disclose speci\ufb01c data sources on \nwhich models were trained, limiting user awareness of whether personally identi\ufb01ably information (PII) \nwas trained on and, if so, how it was collected.  \nModels may leak, generate, or correctly infer sensitive information about individuals. For example, \nduring adversarial attacks, LLMs have revealed sensitive information (from the public domain) that was \nincluded in their training data. This problem has been referred to as data memorization, and may pose \nexacerbated privacy risks even for data present only in a small number of training samples.  \nIn addition to revealing sensitive information in GAI training data, GAI models may be able to correctly \ninfer PII or sensitive data that was not in their training data nor disclosed by the user by stitching \ntogether information from disparate sources. These inferences can have negative impact on an individual \neven if the inferences are not accurate (e.g., confabulations), and especially if they reveal information \nthat the individual considers sensitive or that is used to disadvantage or harm them. \nBeyond harms from information exposure (such as extortion or dignitary harm), wrong or inappropriate \ninferences of PII can contribute to downstream or secondary harmful impacts. For example, predictive \ninferences made by GAI models based on PII or protected attributes can contribute to adverse decisions, \nleading to representational or allocative harms to individuals or groups (see Harmful Bias and \nHomogenization below).  \n",

Environmental Impacts \nTraining, maintaining, and operating (running inference on) GAI systems are resource-intensive activities, \nwith potentially large energy and environmental footprints. Energy and carbon emissions vary based on \nwhat is being done with the GAI model (i.e., pre-training, \ufb01ne-tuning, inference), the modality of the \ncontent, hardware used, and type of task or application. \nCurrent estimates suggest that training a single transformer LLM can emit as much carbon as 300 round-\ntrip \ufb02ights between San Francisco and New York. In a study comparing energy consumption and carbon \nemissions for LLM inference, generative tasks (e.g., text summarization) were found to be more energy- \nand carbon-intensive than discriminative or non-generative tasks (e.g., text classi\ufb01cation).  \nMethods for creating smaller versions of trained models, such as model distillation or compression, \ncould reduce environmental impacts at inference time, but training and tuning such models may still \ncontribute to their environmental impacts. Currently there is no agreed upon method to estimate \nenvironmental impacts from GAI.  \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Safe \n2.6. Harmful Bias and Homogenization \nBias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in automated systems. AI systems, including GAI \nsystems, can increase the speed and scale at which harmful biases manifest and are acted upon, \npotentially perpetuating and amplifying harms to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and \nsociety. For example, when prompted to generate images of CEOs, doctors, lawyers, and judges, current \ntext-to-image models underrepresent women and/or racial minorities, and people with disabilities. \nImage generator models have also produced biased or stereotyped output for various demographic \ngroups and have di\ufb03culty producing non-stereotyped content even when the prompt speci\ufb01cally \nrequests image features that are inconsistent with the stereotypes. Harmful bias in GAI models, which \nmay stem from their training data, can also cause representational harms or perpetuate or exacerbate \nbias based on race, gender, disability, or other protected classes.  \nHarmful bias in GAI systems can also lead to harms via disparities between how a model performs for \ndi\ufb00erent subgroups or languages (e.g., an LLM may perform less well for non-English languages or \ncertain dialects). Such disparities can contribute to discriminatory decision-making or ampli\ufb01cation of \nexisting societal biases. In addition, GAI systems may be inappropriately trusted to perform similarly \nacross all subgroups, which could leave the groups facing underperformance with worse outcomes than \nif no GAI system were used. Disparate or reduced performance for lower-resource languages also \npresents challenges to model adoption, inclusion, and accessibility, and may make preservation of \nendangered languages more di\ufb03cult if GAI systems become embedded in everyday processes that would \notherwise have been opportunities to use these languages.  \nBias is mutually reinforcing with the problem of undesired homogenization, in which GAI systems \nproduce skewed distributions of outputs that are overly uniform (for example, repetitive aesthetic styles \n",

Automation bias can exacerbate other risks of GAI, such as risks of confabulation \nor risks of bias or homogenization. \nThere may also be concerns about emotional entanglement between humans and GAI systems, which \ncould lead to negative psychological impacts. \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Explainable and Interpretable, Fair with \nHarmful Bias Managed, Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Valid and Reliable \n2.8.

This information can be linked to the original source(s) with appropriate evidence. High-integrity \ninformation is also accurate and reliable, can be veri\ufb01ed and authenticated, has a clear chain of custody, \nand creates reasonable expectations about when its validity may expire.\u201d11 \n \n \n11 This de\ufb01nition of information integrity is derived from the 2022 White House Roadmap for Researchers on \nPriorities Related to Information Integrity Research and Development.  \n",

Even \nvery subtle changes to text or images can manipulate human and machine perception. \nSimilarly, GAI systems could enable a higher degree of sophistication for malicious actors to produce \ndisinformation that is targeted towards speci\ufb01c demographics.

Information Security \nInformation security for computer systems and data is a mature \ufb01eld with widely accepted and \nstandardized practices for o\ufb00ensive and defensive cyber capabilities. GAI-based systems present two \nprimary information security risks: GAI could potentially discover or enable new cybersecurity risks by \nlowering the barriers for or easing automated exercise of o\ufb00ensive capabilities; simultaneously, it \nexpands the available attack surface, as GAI itself is vulnerable to attacks like prompt injection or data \npoisoning.  \nO\ufb00ensive cyber capabilities advanced by GAI systems may augment cybersecurity attacks such as \nhacking, malware, and phishing. Reports have indicated that LLMs are already able to discover some \nvulnerabilities in systems (hardware, software, data) and write code to exploit them. Sophisticated threat \nactors might further these risks by developing GAI-powered security co-pilots for use in several parts of \nthe attack chain, including informing attackers on how to proactively evade threat detection and escalate \nprivileges after gaining system access. \nInformation security for GAI models and systems also includes maintaining availability of the GAI system \nand the integrity and (when applicable) the con\ufb01dentiality of the GAI code, training data, and model \nweights.

In direct prompt injections, attackers might craft malicious prompts and \ninput them directly to a GAI system, with a variety of downstream negative consequences to \ninterconnected systems. Indirect prompt injection attacks occur when adversaries remotely (i.e., without \na direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be \nretrieved. Security researchers have already demonstrated how indirect prompt injections can exploit \nvulnerabilities by stealing proprietary data or running malicious code remotely on a machine. Merely \nquerying a closed production model can elicit previously undisclosed information about that model. \nAnother cybersecurity risk to GAI is data poisoning, in which an adversary compromises a training \ndataset used by a model to manipulate its outputs or operation. Malicious tampering with data or parts \nof the model could exacerbate risks associated with GAI system outputs. \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Secure and Resilient, Valid and Reliable \n2.10. \nIntellectual Property \nIntellectual property risks from GAI systems may arise where the use of copyrighted works is not a fair \nuse under the fair use doctrine. If a GAI system\u2019s training data included copyrighted material, GAI \noutputs displaying instances of training data memorization (see Data Privacy above) could infringe on \ncopyright. \nHow GAI relates to copyright, including the status of generated content that is similar to but does not \nstrictly copy work protected by copyright, is currently being debated in legal fora.

The spread of this kind of material can have downstream negative consequences: in \nthe context of CSAM, even if the generated images do not resemble speci\ufb01c individuals, the prevalence \nof such images can divert time and resources from e\ufb00orts to \ufb01nd real-world victims. Outside of CSAM, \nthe creation and spread of NCII disproportionately impacts women and sexual minorities, and can have \nsubsequent negative consequences including decline in overall mental health, substance abuse, and \neven suicidal thoughts.  \nData used for training GAI models may unintentionally include CSAM and NCII.

These considerations (Governance, Pre-Deployment Testing, Content Provenance, \nand Incident Disclosure) are relevant for voluntary use by any organization designing, developing, and \nusing GAI and also inform the Actions to Manage GAI risks. Information included about the primary \nconsiderations is not exhaustive, but highlights the most relevant topics derived from the GAI PWG.  \nAcknowledgments: These considerations could not have been surfaced without the helpful analysis and \ncontributions from the community and NIST sta\ufb00 GAI PWG leads: George Awad, Luca Belli, Harold Booth, \nMat Heyman, Yooyoung Lee, Mark Pryzbocki, Reva Schwartz, Martin Stanley, and Kyra Yee. \nA.1. Governance \nA.1.1. Overview \nLike any other technology system, governance principles and techniques can be used to manage risks \nrelated to generative AI models, capabilities, and applications. Organizations may choose to apply their \nexisting risk tiering to GAI systems, or they may opt to revise or update AI system risk levels to address \nthese unique GAI risks. This section describes how organizational governance regimes may be re-\nevaluated and adjusted for GAI contexts. It also addresses third-party considerations for governing across \nthe AI value chain.  \nA.1.2. Organizational Governance \nGAI opportunities, risks and long-term performance characteristics are typically less well-understood \nthan non-generative AI tools and may be perceived and acted upon by humans in ways that vary greatly. \nAccordingly, GAI may call for di\ufb00erent levels of oversight from AI Actors or di\ufb00erent human-AI \ncon\ufb01gurations in order to manage their risks e\ufb00ectively. Organizations\u2019 use of GAI systems may also \nwarrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight.  \nAI technology can produce varied outputs in multiple modalities and present many classes of user \ninterfaces. This leads to a broader set of AI Actors interacting with GAI systems for widely di\ufb00ering \napplications and contexts of use. These can include data labeling and preparation, development of GAI \nmodels, content moderation, code generation and review, text generation and editing, image and video \ngeneration, summarization, search, and chat. These activities can take place within organizational \nsettings or in the public domain. \nOrganizations can restrict AI applications that cause harm, exceed stated risk tolerances, or that con\ufb02ict \nwith their tolerances or values. Governance tools and protocols that are applied to other types of AI \nsystems can be applied to GAI systems. These plans and actions include: \n\u2022 Accessibility and reasonable \naccommodations \n\u2022 AI actor credentials and quali\ufb01cations  \n\u2022 Alignment to organizational values \n\u2022 Auditing and assessment \n\u2022 Change-management controls \n\u2022 Commercial use \n\u2022 Data provenance \n",

These practices are just \none example of adapting existing governance protocols for GAI contexts.  \nA.1.3. Third-Party Considerations \nOrganizations may seek to acquire, embed, incorporate, or use open-source or proprietary third-party \nGAI models, systems, or generated data for various applications across an enterprise. Use of these GAI \ntools and inputs has implications for all functions of the organization \u2013 including but not limited to \nacquisition, human resources, legal, compliance, and IT services \u2013 regardless of whether they are carried \nout by employees or third parties. Many of the actions cited above are relevant and options for \naddressing third-party considerations. \nThird party GAI integrations may give rise to increased intellectual property, data privacy, or information \nsecurity risks, pointing to the need for clear guidelines for transparency and risk management regarding \nthe collection and use of third-party data for model inputs. Organizations may consider varying risk \ncontrols for foundation models, \ufb01ne-tuned models, and embedded tools, enhanced processes for \ninteracting with external GAI technologies or service providers. Organizations can apply standard or \nexisting risk controls and processes to proprietary or open-source GAI technologies, data, and third-party \nservice providers, including acquisition and procurement due diligence, requests for software bills of \nmaterials (SBOMs), application of service level agreements (SLAs), and statement on standards for \nattestation engagement (SSAE) reports to help with third-party transparency and risk management for \nGAI systems. \nA.1.4. Pre-Deployment Testing \nOverview \nThe diverse ways and contexts in which GAI systems may be developed, used, and repurposed \ncomplicates risk mapping and pre-deployment measurement e\ufb00orts. Robust test, evaluation, validation, \nand veri\ufb01cation (TEVV) processes can be iteratively applied \u2013 and documented \u2013 in early stages of the AI \nlifecycle and informed by representative AI Actors (see Figure 3 of the AI RMF).

This section describes risk measurement and estimation as part of pre-deployment TEVV, \nand examines the state of play for pre-deployment testing methodologies.  \nLimitations of Current Pre-deployment Test Approaches \nCurrently available pre-deployment TEVV processes used for GAI applications may be inadequate, non-\nsystematically applied, or fail to re\ufb02ect or mismatched to deployment contexts. For example, the \nanecdotal testing of GAI system capabilities through video games or standardized tests designed for \nhumans (e.g., intelligence tests, professional licensing exams) does not guarantee GAI system validity or \nreliability in those domains. Similarly, jailbreaking or prompt engineering tests may not systematically \nassess validity or reliability risks.  \nMeasurement gaps can arise from mismatches between laboratory and real-world settings. Current \ntesting approaches often remain focused on laboratory conditions or restricted to benchmark test \ndatasets and in silico techniques that may not extrapolate well to\u2014or directly assess GAI impacts in real-\nworld conditions. For example, current measurement gaps for GAI make it di\ufb03cult to precisely estimate \nits potential ecosystem-level or longitudinal risks and related political, social, and economic impacts. \nGaps between benchmarks and real-world use of GAI systems may likely be exacerbated due to prompt \nsensitivity and broad heterogeneity of contexts of use. \nA.1.5. Structured Public Feedback \nStructured public feedback can be used to evaluate whether GAI systems are performing as intended \nand to calibrate and verify traditional measurement methods. Examples of structured feedback include, \nbut are not limited to: \n\u2022 \nParticipatory Engagement Methods: Methods used to solicit feedback from civil society groups, \na\ufb00ected communities, and users, including focus groups, small user studies, and surveys. \n\u2022 \nField Testing: Methods used to determine how people interact with, consume, use, and make \nsense of AI-generated information, and subsequent actions and e\ufb00ects, including UX, usability, \nand other structured, randomized experiments.  \n\u2022 \nAI Red-teaming: A structured testing exercise used to probe an AI system to \ufb01nd \ufb02aws and \nvulnerabilities such as inaccurate, harmful, or discriminatory outputs, often in a controlled \nenvironment and in collaboration with system developers. \nInformation gathered from structured public feedback can inform design, implementation, deployment \napproval, maintenance, or decommissioning decisions. Results and insights gleaned from these exercises \ncan serve multiple purposes, including improving data quality and preprocessing, bolstering governance \ndecision making, and enhancing system documentation and debugging practices. When implementing \nfeedback activities, organizations should follow human subjects research requirements and best \npractices such as informed consent and subject compensation. \n",

Focus groups with select experts can provide \nfeedback on a range of issues. Small user studies can provide feedback from representative groups or \npopulations. Anonymous surveys can be used to poll or gauge reactions to speci\ufb01c features. Participatory \nengagement methods are often less structured than \ufb01eld testing or red teaming, and are more \ncommonly used in early stages of AI or product development.  \nField Testing \nField testing involves structured settings to evaluate risks and impacts and to simulate the conditions \nunder which the GAI system will be deployed. Field style tests can be adapted from a focus on user \npreferences and experiences towards AI risks and impacts \u2013 both negative and positive. When carried \nout with large groups of users, these tests can provide estimations of the likelihood of risks and impacts \nin real world interactions. \nOrganizations may also collect feedback on outcomes, harms, and user experience directly from users in \nthe production environment after a model has been released, in accordance with human subject \nstandards such as informed consent and compensation. Organizations should follow applicable human \nsubjects research requirements, and best practices such as informed consent and subject compensation, \nwhen implementing feedback activities. \nAI Red-teaming \nAI red-teaming is an evolving practice that references exercises often conducted in a controlled \nenvironment and in collaboration with AI developers building AI models to identify potential adverse \nbehavior or outcomes of a GAI model or system, how they could occur, and stress test safeguards\u201d. AI \nred-teaming can be performed before or after AI models or systems are made available to the broader \npublic; this section focuses on red-teaming in pre-deployment contexts.  \nThe quality of AI red-teaming outputs is related to the background and expertise of the AI red team \nitself. Demographically and interdisciplinarily diverse AI red teams can be used to identify \ufb02aws in the \nvarying contexts where GAI will be used. For best results, AI red teams should demonstrate domain \nexpertise, and awareness of socio-cultural aspects within the deployment context. AI red-teaming results \nshould be given additional analysis before they are incorporated into organizational governance and \ndecision making, policy and procedural updates, and AI risk management e\ufb00orts. \nVarious types of AI red-teaming may be appropriate, depending on the use case: \n\u2022 \nGeneral Public: Performed by general users (not necessarily AI or technical experts) who are \nexpected to use the model or interact with its outputs, and who bring their own lived \nexperiences and perspectives to the task of AI red-teaming.

Content Provenance \nOverview \nGAI technologies can be leveraged for many applications such as content generation and synthetic data. \nSome aspects of GAI outputs, such as the production of deepfake content, can challenge our ability to \ndistinguish human-generated content from AI-generated synthetic content. To help manage and mitigate \nthese risks, digital transparency mechanisms like provenance data tracking can trace the origin and \nhistory of content. Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection can help facilitate greater \ninformation access about both authentic and synthetic content to users, enabling better knowledge of \ntrustworthiness in AI systems. When combined with other organizational accountability mechanisms, \ndigital content transparency approaches can enable processes to trace negative outcomes back to their \nsource, improve information integrity, and uphold public trust. Provenance data tracking and synthetic \ncontent detection mechanisms provide information about the origin and history of content to assist in \nGAI risk management e\ufb00orts. \nProvenance metadata can include information about GAI model developers or creators of GAI content, \ndate/time of creation, location, modi\ufb01cations, and sources. Metadata can be tracked for text, images, \nvideos, audio, and underlying datasets. The implementation of provenance data tracking techniques can \nhelp assess the authenticity, integrity, intellectual property rights, and potential manipulations in digital \ncontent. Some well-known techniques for provenance data tracking include digital watermarking, \nmetadata recording, digital \ufb01ngerprinting, and human authentication, among others. \nProvenance Data Tracking Approaches \nProvenance data tracking techniques for GAI systems can be used to track the history and origin of data \ninputs, metadata, and synthetic content. Provenance data tracking records the origin and history for \ndigital content, allowing its authenticity to be determined. It consists of techniques to record metadata \nas well as overt and covert digital watermarks on content. Data provenance refers to tracking the origin \nand history of input data through metadata and digital watermarking techniques. Provenance data \ntracking processes can include and assist AI Actors across the lifecycle who may not have full visibility or \ncontrol over the various trade-o\ufb00s and cascading impacts of early-stage model decisions on downstream \nperformance and synthetic outputs. For example, by selecting a watermarking model to prioritize \nrobustness (the durability of a watermark), an AI actor may inadvertently diminish computational \ncomplexity (the resources required to implement watermarking). Organizational risk management \ne\ufb00orts for enhancing content provenance include:  \n\u2022 \nTracking provenance of training data and metadata for GAI systems; \n\u2022 \nDocumenting provenance data limitations within GAI systems; \n",

Further narrowing of GAI task de\ufb01nitions to include provenance data can \nenable organizations to maximize the utility of provenance data and risk management e\ufb00orts. \nA.1.7. Enhancing Content Provenance through Structured Public Feedback \nWhile indirect feedback methods such as automated error collection systems are useful, they often lack \nthe context and depth that direct input from end users can provide. Organizations can leverage feedback \napproaches described in the Pre-Deployment Testing section to capture input from external sources such \nas through AI red-teaming.  \nIntegrating pre- and post-deployment external feedback into the monitoring process for GAI models and \ncorresponding applications can help enhance awareness of performance changes and mitigate potential \nrisks and harms from outputs. There are many ways to capture and make use of user feedback \u2013 before \nand after GAI systems and digital content transparency approaches are deployed \u2013 to gain insights about \nauthentication e\ufb03cacy and vulnerabilities, impacts of adversarial threats on techniques, and unintended \nconsequences resulting from the utilization of content provenance approaches on users and \ncommunities. Furthermore, organizations can track and document the provenance of datasets to identify \ninstances in which AI-generated data is a potential root cause of performance issues with the GAI \nsystem. \nA.1.8. Incident Disclosure \nOverview \nAI incidents can be de\ufb01ned as an \u201cevent, circumstance, or series of events where the development, use, \nor malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly contributes to one of the following harms: \ninjury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people (including psychological harms and harms to \nmental health); disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; violations of \nhuman rights or a breach of obligations under applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labor, \nand intellectual property rights; or harm to property, communities, or the environment.\u201d AI incidents can \noccur in the aggregate (i.e., for systemic discrimination) or acutely (i.e., for one individual). \nState of AI Incident Tracking and Disclosure \nFormal channels do not currently exist to report and document AI incidents. However, a number of \npublicly available databases have been created to document their occurrence. These reporting channels \nmake decisions on an ad hoc basis about what kinds of incidents to track. Some, for example, track by \namount of media coverage.  \n",

Greater awareness \nand standardization of GAI incident reporting could promote this transparency and improve GAI risk \nmanagement across the AI ecosystem.  \nDocumentation and Involvement of AI Actors \nAI Actors should be aware of their roles in reporting AI incidents. To better understand previous incidents \nand implement measures to prevent similar ones in the future, organizations could consider developing \nguidelines for publicly available incident reporting which include information about AI actor \nresponsibilities. These guidelines would help AI system operators identify GAI incidents across the AI \nlifecycle and with AI Actors regardless of role. Documentation and review of third-party inputs and \nplugins for GAI systems is especially important for AI Actors in the context of incident disclosure; LLM \ninputs and content delivered through these plugins is often distributed, with inconsistent or insu\ufb03cient \naccess control. \nDocumentation practices including logging, recording, and analyzing GAI incidents can facilitate \nsmoother sharing of information with relevant AI Actors. Regular information sharing, change \nmanagement records, version history and metadata can also empower AI Actors responding to and \nmanaging AI incidents.  \n \n",
